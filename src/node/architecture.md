# Architecture

The architecture of the Xian blockchain is designed with modularity, scalability, and security at its core, leveraging a combination of industry-leading technologies and innovative solutions to create a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This section will outline the key components of Xian's architecture, illustrating how these elements work together to provide a seamless and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

## **High-Level Overview**

Xian's blockchain architecture is built upon several foundational layers, each serving a distinct purpose within the ecosystem:

* **Consensus Layer**: Utilizes CometBFT for fast and secure transaction validation, ensuring instant finality and high throughput.
* **Networking Layer**: Facilitates communication between nodes in the Xian network, allowing for efficient dissemination of transactions and blocks.
* **Application Layer**: Hosted by the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), this layer is where the blockchainâ€™s state and the logic of smart contracts reside, enabling the development and execution of decentralized applications in a variety of programming languages, notably through Contracting for smart contracts.

## **Detailed Component Interaction**

1. **Transaction Flow**:
   * Users interact with the Xian blockchain by submitting transactions through client applications. These transactions are always smart contract executions.
   * Transactions are first broadcast to a node and the gossip protocol takes care of every node picking it up.
   * Validators use the CometBFT consensus engine to agree on the validity and order of transactions, ensuring that all nodes maintain a consistent state.
2. **Smart Contract Execution**:
   * When a transaction involves a smart contract, it is executed within the Application Layer, specifically within the sandboxed environment provided by Contracting.
   * The execution of smart contracts can read from and write to the blockchain's state, allowing for complex interactions and state changes based on the logic defined in the contract.
3. **Blockchain State Management**:
   * The ABCI facilitates the communication between the consensus layer and the application layer, allowing the blockchain state to be updated securely and efficiently after each block is finalized.
   * The state includes all storages, smart contract code, and the results of smart contract executions, ensuring that the entire network agrees on the current state of the blockchain.
4.  **Governance and Upgrades**:

    * Governance actions, such as voting for validators or proposing changes to the network parameters, are facilitated through transactions and smart contracts.



## **Security and Scalability**

* **Security**: Xian employs multiple layers of security measures, including the sandboxing of smart contracts, cryptographic verification of transactions, and the secure consensus mechanism provided by CometBFT.
* **Scalability**: The use of CometBFT consensus, along with the efficient design of the ABCI and Contracting, ensures that the Xian blockchain can scale to handle a high volume of transactions without compromising on speed or security
